          <p>This was me at the graduation ceromony for my Associates Degree in Applied Science.  A lot of people said that it would be impossible to work full time and go to school full time.  I eventually got there.  It wasn't easy.  But I eventually got there.  I even made the Deans's list.  Twice.  I'm not saying it was all fun and games.  There were so many bumps in the road along the way.  But, walking down that eisle was the smoothest part of the whole thing.  </p>
          <p>My freshman year, I took CEC 101.  There were two professors teaching the class.  One of them said something I'll never forget.  He said, "college is not a walk in the park.  You're going to have to really take ownership of your education."  That struck a chord with me.  I treated as a philosophy for life.  I even wrote it on the mirror in my bathroom with a dry-erase marker.</p>
          <p>Just because you hear a lot of people say that something is "impossible", doesn't mean that it is impossible for you.  All it really means is that you're probably going to have to work really hard.  Never be afraid to outperform others.</p>
